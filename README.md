## Learning Registry


The Learning Registry makes digital learning resources easier to find, easier to access and easier to integrate into learning environments wherever they are stored -- around the country and the world. This will enable teachers, students, parents, schools, governments, corporations and non-profits to build and access better, more interconnected and personalized learning solutions needed for a 21st-century education.  You can find more information on the Learning Registry project at the [Learning Registry Web Site](http://www.learningregistry.org/).

## Getting Started
