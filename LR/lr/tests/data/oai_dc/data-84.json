Rotogravure printing, which produced richly detailed, high quality illustrations, even on inexpensive newsprint paper, was used to create vivid new pictorial sections. Publishers that could afford to invest in the new technology saw sharp increases both in readership and advertising revenue. The images in this collection track American sentiment about the war in Europe, week by week, before and after the United States became involved. Events of the war are detailed alongside society news and advertisements touting products of the day, creating a pictorial record of both the war effort and life at home. The collection includes an illustrated history of World War I selected from newspaper rotogravure sections that graphically documents the people, places, and events important to the war.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Title from Web page (viewed on Oct. 28, 2004).</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Offered as part of the American Memory online resource compiled by the National Digital Library Program of the Library of Congress.</dc:description>\n<dc:publisher>Washington, DC : Library of Congress</dc:publisher>\n<dc:type>image</dc:type>\n<dc:type>still image</dc:type>\n<dc:identifier>http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000037</dc:identifier>\n<dc:language>eng</dc:language>\n</oai_dc:dc>\n      ", "keys": ["World War, 1914-1918--Pictorial works.", "World War, 1914-1918--Photography.", "Rotogravures.", "Rotogravure printing", "War photography", "New York Times", "New York Tribune", "War of the Nations", "Portfolio in Rotogravure Etchings", "eng"], "payload_placement": "inline", "active": true, "resource_locator": "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000037", "submission_TOS": "Yes", "doc_type": "resource_data", "submitter_type": "agent", "resource_data_type": "metadata", "payload_schema_locator": "http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd", "payload_schema": ["oai_dc"], "doc_version": "0.10.0", "submitter": "NSDL 2 LR Data Pump"}, {"resource_data": "<oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/                          http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">\n<dc:title>Parallel histories Spain, the United States, and the American frontier = Historias paralelas : Espan&#771;a, Estados Unidos y la frontera americana.</dc:title>\n<dc:creator>Library of Congress.

The former slaves discuss how they felt about slavery, slaveholders, how slaves were coerced, their families, and, of course, freedom. They have much to say about living as African Americans from the 1870s to the 1930s, and beyond.

The collection contains, for example, several Asian, Native American, and other specimens which, although in effect real instruments, appear to have been made for tourist and souvenir sales. Several others seem to be failed attempts at constructing replica instruments during the initial phases of the early music (or period instrument) movement. However, the quality of much of the collection is high and displays examples of pristine craftsmanship involving precious metals, ivory, jade, tortoise shell, and nearly every wood traditionally associated with woodwind instrument construction. Two of the better quality examples are flutes of Miller's own design involving major elements of construction on his part. The collection also includes numerous examples of advanced technical developments from the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as books about music and flute treatises (cataloged and classified in ML30.4b), music (cataloged and classified in ML30.4c), numerous patents, trade catalogs, and correspondence from wind instrument manufacturers, flutists' portraits, photographs, autographs, and correspondence; news clippings and articles; graphics such as prints, etchings, and lithographs (mostly pictures of flutists and pipers), and over sixty figurines including three bronzes and three finely carved ivory netsukes; plus other music-related ephemera.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Cite as: Dayton C. Miller flute collection, Music Division, Library of Congress.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>American scientist Dayton C. Miller was born in Strongsville, Ohio, March 13, 1866, and grew up in the small Ohio town of Berea. He worked his way through Baldwin University (later Baldwin-Wallace College). In 1886 he gave a lecture about the sun and also played a flute solo with orchestra. Later he obtained a doctorate in astronomy at Princeton University and in 1890 began an association with the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland that lasted for over 50 years. In 1908 he introduced the phonodeik, a device that until the invention of electronic oscillators was one of the chief means of converting sound waves into visual images and thus of analyzing all manner of sounds from musical instruments to human speech. Miller's interests in acoustics and music-making were chiefly responsible for his starting, and are reflected in, his collection of flutes and wind instruments. Miller died on Feb. 22, 1941, in Cleveland.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>Bequest; Dayton C.

The majority of the images depict Palestine (present day Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip). Other countries shown are Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. There is some coverage of East African countries including Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, and Uganda. Pictures portray religious ceremonies, daily life, arts and crafts, archaeological sites, schools, hospitals, vegetation historic buildings and sites, demonstrations and conflicts, important events, political leaders, and landscapes. Also included are aerial photographs, portraits, and posed pictures depicting Biblical scenes.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>The relationship of the negatives to the transparencies and photographic prints is complex. A set of 11 albums used by the Matson Photo Service in their Jerusalem store include cropped images of 5,000 of the negatives. Two other albums \"Air Views of Palestine\" (LOT 12016 ) and \"Easter services in Church of the Holy Sepulchre, 1941\" (LOT 13765) are also reproduced from negatives. Many of the 35mm slides, lantern slides, transparencies, and other photographic material were probably made from the negatives at some point as well. In some cases, the original negatives have not been found in the material held by the Prints and Photographs Division. In these instances, the photographic prints or the transparencies may be the only version of a particular image.</dc:description>\n<dc:description>A supplementary archive includes: published catalogs, logbooks, and caption lists; booklets for slide sets, glass finlay screens, and examples of Matson Photo Service slide set boxes. A complete list of items in the supplementary archive is found in the Matson Collection collection file.
