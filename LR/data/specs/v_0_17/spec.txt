Technical Specification Introduction
This document provides the technical specification for the Learning Registry.  It specifies the network model, data models and APIs.  It does not specify policy-based operational procedures or the instantiation of the Learning Registry.  While targeted at a document-oriented infrastructure, the specification itself is independent of any particular toolset.  The document is currently a work in progress; its structure, organization and content are subject to change.  All information is in this single monolithic document.
Learning Registry Overview
The Learning Registry [http://learningregistry.org] aims to make “learning resources easier to find, easier to access and easier to integrate into learning environments wherever they are stored -- around the country and the world.”  It defines a learning resource distribution network model and a set of open APIs and open interoperability standards to provide three fundamental, enabling capabilities:
1. a lightweight mechanism to publish (push) learning resources (or metadata or paradata describing the resources) into a learning resource distribution network, independent of format or data type (e.g., resource, metadata or paradata);
2. the ability for anyone to consume the published data and then, in turn, to publish additional feedback about the resources’ use into the network (e.g., additional paradata), amplifying the overall knowledge about the resources;
3. a high-latency, loosely connected network of master-master synchronizing brokers distributing resources, metadata and paradata.
There is no central control, central registries or central repositories in the core resource distribution network.  Published data can eventually flow to all nodes in the network.  The network aims to be self assembling.  Edge services can connect to any distribution node to find out what resources (and resource sources) are in the network, what’s changed, what’s being used, etc.  Organizations may build consumer-facing, value-added services at the edge nodes to enable using, finding, sharing, and amplifying the resources, metadata and paradata for user communities.  The Learning Registry provides social networking for metadata (trusted social collaboration around learning resources), enabling a learning layer on the social web.
Specification License
This specification is being developed under the Open Web Foundation Contributor License Agreement - Contributor Copyright Grant (CLA 0.9).  The intent is that the final specification will be released under the Open Web Foundation Agreement (OWFa 0.9).  Later versions may apply.
 
Your use of this Specification may be subject to other third party rights. THIS SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” The contributors expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification. The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is assumed by the Specification implementer and user. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS SPECIFICATION OR ITS GOVERNING AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
Notation
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
 
The vocabulary of terms used in describing the Learning Registry are listed in the Glossary.  Specific terms are set in bold when introduced in context.
 
Data models are described in a JSON-like notation.  It follows JSON syntax, but instead of providing the value for a name, the data model defines the JavaScript data type of the named element.  A description of the element, further restrictions on the value space (e.g., if a string is a URL) and if the element is optional or required is described in a comment.  This model is used for convenience in early prototyping.  A future version of the specification may describe the data models and their implementation binding independently.
Conformance
There is no overall conformance statement for this specification.  The Learning Registry Test Suite (link TBD) MAY be used to test an implementation.  However, passing the Test Suite does not imply conformance to this specification.  There is no defined “reference implementation” (by definition when there is a conflict between this specification and the reference implementation, the reference implementation is considered to be authoritative).
 
All pseudo code is informative; it is not a normative implementation design.  Behaviors defined in pseudo code are normative requirements on an implementation.  Behaviors are usually defined in normative text.
 
An organization MAY place tighter requirements on an implementation than those stated, e.g., it MAY constrain a MAY, SHOULD or OPTIONAL clause to MUST, SHALL or REQUIRED.  It MAY NOT relax any constraint.
Technical Specification Overview
The specification is split into several parts:
1. Network:  The description of the resource distribution network and its parts.  A fixed multi-level structure of network parts is used to support distributing content and to provide policy-based security and operations.
2. Data Models:  The data models that are used to describe the network and learning resources data.  Data models are document oriented.
3. APIs:  The APIs used to publish and consume data and those used to operate the network.  The APIs are designed to abstract the logical behaviors of the Learning Registry from any particular implementation tools.
4. Operations:  Operational procedures that apply to any implementation.
Design Principles
The learning registry design and technical specification is based on several key principles:
1. Decentralized:  There are no centralized registries or repositories or central data stores.  Thus all core data is replicated across the network.
2. Redundant:  There is no single point of failure in the design (an implementation may have single points of failure).
3. Abstracted:  Abstraction is critical to layering capabilities, e.g., network content replication is content type agnostic.  
4. Minimal:  Specify only what is required.  Features that are community specific or can be layered on top of the core design are excluded from the specification although essential elements needed to support such modeling are included.
5. Generic:  Prefer approaches, models, standards, etc., that have wide uptake beyond just the learning technology and digital repository space.
6. Secure:  Security is by design, e.g., default values lock down an implementation and must be explicitly overridden even to do common operations.
7. Trusted:  Data and operations need to be authentic and trusted
8. Document Oriented:  The design is targeted at a document-oriented system for implementation using document-oriented databases.
9. RESTful:  APIs are RESTful, and use CoolURIs to return different data representations.
10. Scalable:  The design needs to seamlessly scale and perform at scale.
11. Extensible and Enabling:  The design is meant to enable new capabilities.  Unless explicitly restricted (usually to satisfy security requirements) anything in the design is extensible.
12. Web 2.0 Friendly:  The design is based on current, widely implemented Web 2.0 technologies.
Resource Distribution Network Model
The core of the Learning Registry is the network of loosely connected master-master synchronizing broker nodes distributing resources, metadata and paradata.  Consumers and producers (edge node consumer and producer agents) connect to network nodes to inject information into the network or to extract information for external processing.
 
The network model is defined in terms of nodes, their services, the assembly of nodes into resource distribution networks, and the structuring of networks into communities.  This two-tiered model of networks and communities supports security requirements for partitioning of resource data between different communities.
Network Nodes and Node Services
A node is a server process with network connectivity to either other nodes or to edge services.  Nodes process resource data (e.g., network messages about resources, metadata, paradata, etc.).
 
A node SHALL be described using the network node data model.  Only the owner of a node description MAY change the description.  Certain attributes of the node description are immutable.  NB: These are security constraints.
 
A node MAY provide five (5) different classes of services (APIs, services protocols and data models are detailed below) :
1. Publish Services:  Publish services are used by external agents to push (publish) resource data from the external agent into the distribution network.  The data model for publication data is specified below.  A node that provides publish services MAY support different publishing APIs, but all SHALL use the publication data model.  The definitions of several common publishing APIs are specified below.
2. Access Services:  Access services are used by external agents to discover, access and obtain (pull) resource data from the distribution network.  A node that provides access services MAY support different access APIs.  The definitions of several common access APIs are specified below.
3. Distribution Services:  Distribution services are used to transfer, replicate and synchronize resource data from node X to node Y.  X is the source node for distribution, Y is the destination node.   To support security requirements, distribution is directed from X to Y; independent paired services [X→Y + Y→X] are used for bi-directional synchronization.  The distribution services SHALL use the distribution data model specified below.
4. Broker Services:  Broker services operate at a node to augment, transform or process resource data held at that node to produce new or updated resource data for access or distribution. A node that provides broker services MAY support different broker processes.  The definitions of several common broker processes are specified below.
5. Administrative Services:  Administrative services are used to query a node to obtain its status or to trigger node administrative actions.  The definitions of several common administrative services and APIs are specified below.
Network Topology
A resource distribution network is a group of one or more connected nodes, with each node providing node services.  All nodes in a resource distribution network operate under the same policies.  Multiple resource distribution networks MAY be established.
 
A resource distribution network SHALL be described using the resource distribution network data model.  Only the owner of a network description MAY change the description.  Certain attributes of the resource distribution network description are immutable.  NB: These are security constraints.
 
Two types of network nodes and connectivity within a network are defined:
1. Common Node:  A common node MAY provide any of the node service classes listed.  If provided, the distribution services of a common node SHALL be limited to connecting to other nodes in the same network (the distribution service MAY connect to multiple destination nodes).  A common node is denoted CN herein.
2. Gateway Node:  A gateway node SHALL provide a distribution service.  A gateway node MAY connect to one or more common nodes within the same network.  A gateway node SHALL connect to and provide resource distribution to a gateway node in another network.  A gateway node MAY provide administrative services.  A gateway node SHALL NOT provide publish, access or broker services.  A gateway node is denoted GN herein.  NB: As defined, a gateway is a 1:1 interconnect between two networks.  1:1 is used to simplify topology in support of security requirements; it is not a technical constraint.  NB:  Multiple gateway nodes between two networks are permitted.
 
A node SHALL participate in, and be subject to the policies of, only one resource distribution network.
 
A node SHALL not transition or be moved from one resource distribution network to another.  A node MAY only be added to or removed from a distribution network.  NB: This is a security constraint.
 
A gateway node X that participates in some network N1 SHALL connect to a gateway node Y that participates in some other network N2.  A gateway node SHALL NOT connect to any other nodes in network N2 or to any node in any other network.
 
A network community is a collection of interconnected resource distribution networks.  A community MAY contain one or more resource distribution networks.  A resource network SHALL be a member of only one community.   Gateway nodes provide the connectivity between resources networks within a network community and MAY provide connectivity between networks in different communities. NB:  A gateway node that provides an intra-community network gateway is undifferentiated from one that provides an inter-community network gateway.
 
A network community SHALL be described using the network community data model.  Only the owner of a network community description MAY change the description.  Certain attributes of the network community description are immutable.  NB: These are security constraints.
 
Two types of network communities are defined:
1. Social Community:  A social community provides connectivity to other social communities.  A network within a social community MAY connect to another network within the same social community or with a network that belongs to a different social community.
2. Closed Community:  A closed community provides no connectivity outside of the community. A network within a closed community  SHALL NOT connect with another network within a different community.
 
For example, the Learning Registry is a social community; other social communities may connect to the Learning Registry community.  For security and testing, the Learning Registry Testbed is a closed community, i.e., it consists of different networks (multiple networks to enable testing gateway protocols) but the testbed cannot be connected to the social production community.   
 
The Learning Registry community might consist of multiple networks and gateways.  One network might be for uncurated OERs (open educational resources).  A second network might be for curated OERs.  And several others networks could be established for commercial resources (e.g., one per publisher).   If the uncurated OER network has a gateway to the curated OER network, and there are gateways to each commercial networks, resource data can flow in only one direction, e.g., resource data for OERs into the commercial networks, but not the reverse.
 
A network SHALL not transition or be moved from one network community to another.  A network MAY only be added to or removed from a network community.  NB: This is a security constraint.
 
The resource network model provides nodes, collections of connected nodes within a network and the interconnection of networks in communities.  The network model has this fixed hierarchy of components.  Network communities connect to other communities using the same mechanism as networks that connect within a community.  
 
Other network topology restrictions MAY be established by the policies of a particular network or community.  This specification is intentionally minimal and does not define or limit other topologies, including degenerate topologies.  NB: The model lets one design a network topology that might violate the policy and security constraints of a participating organization.
 
The diagram illustrates the network model.  In the diagram there are three resource distribution networks (A, B, C) and two network communities (X and Y).  Resource distribution network A connects to network B; both are part of the same community.  Resource distribution network A also connects to network C and network C connects to network B.  Resource distribution network C is in a different network community from A and B.  If either network community X or Y was a closed community, the inter-network connection would not be permitted.
 
Network Data Models
The description of a network is maintained in a set of documents that includes:
1. Network Node documents:
1. The description of the node.
2. The description of the connectivity of the node within the network (including gateways).
3. The description of the services provided by the node.
4. The description of the filters applied at a node.
1. Resource Distribution Network documents:
1. The description of the resource distribution network that the node is a part of.
2. The description of the policies that govern the resource distribution network.
1. Network Community documents:
1. The description of the network community that the node is a part of.
 
All data models MAY be extended with additional elements. The name of any extension element SHALL begin with the characters “X_” designating an extension element.  Any document that includes any element that is not in the defined data model or is not an extension element is non conforming and SHALL be rejected by any service.
 
All data models have a named attribute that is a “type” element (doc_type).  The data model description specifies the literal value for this element for all instances of each type of document.
 
All data models have a named attribute that is a “version” element (doc_version).  The data model description specifies the literal value for this element for all document instances.
 
All data models have a named attribute that indicates if the document instance is in use (active).   Network data model document instances are never deleted; they transition from active to not active.
 
Additional constraints on attributes values are detailed below.
Network Node Description Data Model
The data model describing a node document.  Once the data model has been instantiated for a node, the value of an immutable element SHALL NOT change.  Other values MAY be changed only by the owner of the node document.

"doc_type":                “node_description”,        // the literal “node_description”

"doc_version":                “0.10.0”,        // the literal for the current version -- “0.10.0”

"node_admin_url":        “string”,                // URL of node admin, optional
"network_id":                “string”,                // id of the network that this node is a part of                 
// recommended (required for gateway distribution)
// immutable
        "community_id":                “string”,                // id of the community that this node is a part of
                                                // recommended (required for gateway distribution)

        "gateway_node":        boolean,        // T if node is a gateway node
                                                // recommended, F if not present, immutable
        "open_connect_source":boolean,        // T if node is willing to be the source to
// connect to any other node
                                                // F if node connectivity is restricted
                                                // recommended; F if not present
        "open_connect_dest":        boolean,        // T if node is willing to be the destination
//  to connect to any other node
                                                // F if node connectivity is restricted
                                                // recommended; F if not present
        “node_policy”:                                // node-specific policies, optional
         {
"sync_frequency":        integer,                // target time between synchronizations in minutes
// optional
          “deleted_data_policy”:        “string”                // fixed vocabulary [“no”, “persistent”, “transient”]
                                                // see resource data persistence
          }
"X_xxx":                ?????                // placeholder for extensibility, optional
        }
 
NB:  Synchronization/replication frequency is maintained on a per node basis.  This allows each node to sync on a different frequency (versus a network wide sync frequency), but does not allow each connection to a node to sync on a different frequency, which might complicate scheduling.
NB:  The deleted data policy is used to support OAI-PMH harvest.  It is part of the node description and not the service description since it controls overall node behavior and data persistence.
Network Node Service Description Data Model
The data model describing a service description document; one document per service available at a node.  Once the data model has been instantiated for a service, the value of an immutable element SHALL NOT change.  Other values MAY be changed only by the owner of the node document.  
NB:  Ownership and control of the node description document and of the node service description document are vested in the same identity.
        {
"doc_type":                “service_description”,        // the literal “node_description”

                                                // not the version of some underlying spec for the service
        "service_endpoint":        “string”,                // URL of service, required
        "service_auth":                “string”,                 // fixed vocabulary [“public, …]

        }
 
Open Question:  What is the auth vocabulary?
Network Node Connectivity Description Data Model
The data model describing a node connectivity document; one document per connection at a node.  Once the data model has been instantiated for a connection, the value of an immutable element SHALL NOT change.  Other values MAY be changed only by the owner of the node document.  
NB:  Ownership and control of the node description document and of the node connectivity description document are vested in the same identity.
{
"doc_type":                “connection_description”,        // the literal “connection_description”
                                                        // required, immutable
"doc_version":                “0.10.0”,        // the literal for the current version -- “0.10.0”
                                        // required, immutable
"doc_scope":                “node”,                // the literal “node”

"active":                boolean,        // is the connection active
                                        // required, mutable from T to F only
"connection_id":        “string”,                // id of the connection, required
// unique within scope of the LR
// immutable
        "source_node_url":        “string”,                // URL of the source of the connection
// required, immutable
        "destination_node_url":        “string”,                // URL of the destination of the connection
                                                // required, immutable
        "gateway_connection":        boolean,        // T if this is a connection to a gateway node
// F for a common node
                                                // recommended;  F if not present (common node)
                                                // immutable
"X_xxx":                ?????                // placeholder for extensibility, optional
        }
 
NB: By policy, there SHALL be only one document with a gateway_connection value of T per node.
NB: The source URL is not strictly needed.  It is present to enable building a network map.
Working Assumption: It is assumed that a vocabulary to describe additional types of connections is not needed.
Network Node Filter Description Data Model

Network Description
A valid, consistent network SHALL be described through a set of documents stored at each node in the network.
1. Each node SHALL store one instance of the network node description document.  A document SHALL be unique per node.
2. Each node SHALL store one instance of the network node services document for each service that it provides.  A document SHALL be unique per node.
3. Each node SHALL store one instance of the network node connectivity document for each connection to the node.  A document SHALL be unique per node.
4. Each node MAY store one instance of the network node filter document.  A document SHALL be unique per node.
5. Each node SHALL store one instance of the resource distribution network description document.  This document SHALL describe the network that the node is a part of.  The contents of this document SHALL be identical for all nodes in the network. 
6. Each node SHALL store one instance of the resource distribution network policy document.  This document SHALL describe the policies of the network that the node is a part of.  The contents of this document SHALL be identical for all nodes in the network. 
7. The node SHALL store one instance of the network community description document.  This document SHALL describe the community that the network is a part of.  The contents of this document SHALL be identical for all nodes in the community. 
 
Additional types of node and network description documents MAY be defined, but SHALL be defined as either (1) unique per node, (2) identical for nodes in a network or (3) identical for all nodes in a community.  Other organizational classifications SHALL NOT be used.
 
The illustration shows the mapping of documents to nodes and the distribution and synchronization of documents within resource distribution networks and network communities.  NB: Filters are not shown.
 
Resource Data Data Models
The resource distribution network and its nodes process and distribute resource data (e.g., network messages about resources, metadata, paradata, etc.).  Producer edge nodes publish resource data to a node of the network; the resource distribution network moves it to other nodes, and consumer edge nodes pull resource data for external use from nodes.
 
Resource data is described in a different documents that includes:
1. The description of the resource, metadata, paradata, etc. 
 
All data models MAY be extended with additional elements. The name of any extension element SHALL begin with the characters “X_” designating an extension element.  Any document that includes any element that is not is the defined data model or is not an extension element is non conforming and SHALL be rejected by any service.
 
All data models have a named attribute that is a “type” element (doc_type).  The data model description specifies the literal value for this element for all instances of each type of document.
 
All data models have a named attribute that is a “version” element (doc_version).  The data model description specifies the literal value for this element for all document instances.
 
Additional constraints on attributes values are detailed below.
Resource Data Description Data Model
The data model describing resources, metadata, paradata, etc., that is distributed by the resource distribution network.  The data model MAY be extended with additional optional, mutable elements that describe a resource and have a character string value space.  The name of such an element SHALL begin with the characters “resource_”.  Once the data model has been instantiated the value of an immutable element SHALL NOT change.  Other values MAY be changed only by the owner of the document.

Open Question:  Is this the appropriate. minimal list of resource_* attributes needed for filtering?
Open Question: Is there a use case that requires create_timestamp?
Open Question: Is locator sufficient, or do we still need an ID for the resource?
NB:  Need to agree on the conventions for valid submitter, owner and TOS strings.
NB:  Separating owner from submitter enables 3rd party submissions.
NB:  The supplied resource_locator SHALL be a unique ID within the scope of the Learning Registry and SHALL resolve to a single resource from which someone may uniquely access the resource.  The resource_locator is used to correlate multiple resource data descriptions about a single resource.  Thus the locator needs to be specific to the resource.
NB:  A resource data description document contains only one set of resource data (metadata, paradata).
NB: To submit data only for a resource (no metadata or paradata), the payload attributes MAY be omitted.
NB: There is currently no mechanism to update the resource_* attributes without resubmitting the metadata or paradata about the resource. This is consistent with document-oriented transactional atomicity.
NB: Best practices of how to use the resource_* attributes and how to encode values are not provided.
NB: Some elements MAY be mapped to DC terms or LOM schema elements.

Metadata Formats
The metadata in a resource data description MAY be defined using any metadata standard.  Metadata documents SHALL include the reference to the defining standard or schema.  The following list of schema values SHALL be used to refer to common schemata.  Implementations MAY extend this list.
 
Metadata Standard
	payload_schema value
	Dublin Core 1.1
	“DC 1.1”
	IEEE LOM 2002
	“IEEE LOM 2002”
	 
Attached and linked metadata SHALL include appropriate schema definitions and schema locators in the metadata file. 
 
NB. There is currently no machine-readable list of schemata.  Such a list could be defined in additional network description documents.
 
Inline metadata SHALL be encoded in JSON structure or as a single JSON string wrapping the entire metadata document.
 
JSON encodings of metadata schemata (primarily for inline resource data) will be provided in a future draft of the specification.
Paradata Formats
The paradata in a resource data description MAY be defined using any paradata standard.  Paradata documents SHALL include the reference to the defining standard or schema.  The following list of schema values SHALL be used to refer to common schemata.  Implementations MAY extend this list.
 
Paradata Standard
	payload_schema value
	 
	 
	 
Attached and linked paradata SHALL include appropriate schema definitions and schema locators in the paradata file. 
 
NB. There is currently no machine-readable list of schemata.  Such a list could be defined in additional network description documents.
 
Inline paradata SHALL be encoded in JSON structure or as a single JSON string wrapping the entire paradata document.
 
JSON encodings of paradata schemata (primarily for inline resource data) will be provided in a future draft of the specification.
Resource Data
The resource data SHALL be maintained in a set of documents stored at each node in the network.
1. Each node MAY store one or more instances of the resource data description documents.  All document instances stored at a node SHALL be unique.  A document MAY be replicated at many nodes.
 
Additional types of resource documents MAY be defined, but SHALL be defined as unique per node.  Other types of resource documents SHALL NOT be replicated.  Other organizational classifications SHALL NOT be used.  NB:  This constraint is meant to restrict placing resource data in multiple different databases.
Trust and Identity
The section on trust and identity will be provided in a future version or draft of the specification.
Security and Information Assurance
The section on security and information assurance will be provided in a future version or draft of the specification. 
 
All services SHOULD maintain a secure log of all service actions.  Details of logging requirements will be provided in a future version or draft of the specification.
Services and APIs
The services and their APIs provide the functionality that edge node producer and consumer agents use to push resource data into the distribution network and to discover and pull resource data from the network.  They also define how to distribute the resource data throughout a network and how to manage and observe resource distribution network behavior.
 
The defined list of services follows.  Any non gateway node MAY provide any of these services.  A node MAY provide additional services not specified herein.
 
NB:  There is no mechanism to reserve names for APIs, tag them as authoritative (i.e., they are defined in this specification), etc.  A future version of the specification MAY extend the service definition to include tags (e.g., authoritative, experimental, third-party) and other validation or conformance information.
 
Services and APIs are RESTful and bound to a particular node in the resource distribution network.  Service descriptions include the API call (HTTP binding), the API arguments, the message payload (using the JSON-like notation), the service results (using JSON-like notation), an informative pseudo code description of a possible implementation, and the network node service description data model.
 
The network node service description data model provides a machine and human readable description of the service; an instance of the description document is stored at the node that provides the service.
 
Additional constraints on API attributes, HTTP bindings (headers, HTTP errors), error processing and behaviors are described below.
Resource Data Distribution Service
The resource data distribution service is used to distribute (synchronize or replicate) the resource data from one node to its connected nodes (unidirectional).  Future drafts or versions of this specification MAY define additional resource data distribution services.
 
A task scheduler SHOULD trigger resource data distribution from a source node to all of its destination nodes according to the frequency specified by the sync_frequency in the node description document.

NB: There may be a better way to do the validations via map-reduce.
NB: Since all attributes of the network that model its topology are immutable, the replication process should be transactionally safe.
NB: The process is only designed to distribute resource data.  It encodes specific business rules about gateway processing.  It SHOULD NOT be used to distribute network descriptions.
NB: The process does not return errors when there are bad connection descriptions; they are skipped.  A bad connection should never have been accepted; the checks are included to ensure consistency.

NB: The process does not return indicators when documents are filtered.
NB:  An implementation SHALL maintain node_timestamp in a manner that does not trigger redistibution of the document; node_timestamp is a local node value.

Resource Data Publish Services
Publish services are used to push resource data into the network.  They are used by publishing edge nodes.  All resource data publishing services SHALL apply filters if present to restrict the resource data that is published to the node.  All resource data publishing services SHALL apply validation to restrict the resource data that is published to the node. The validation process MAY also provide local updates to the resource document prior to it being published.
 
Future drafts or versions of this specification MAY define additional resource data publish services.
Basic Publish Service
The basic publish service pushes an instance of a resource data description document (or a set of documents) directly to a node in a resource distribution network.  It is the most basic, direct mechanism to publish resource data.  
 
Each resource data description document in the supplied set is published independently. In addition to the overall service return indicating status,  there SHALL be one returned object per resource data description document, aligned 1:1 to the documents in the supplied resource data description document array, indicating status of publishing of the resource data description document.
 
Each resource data description document SHALL be published to the node’s resource data description document database.  Prior to being published, it SHALL be validated: e.g., the syntax MUST be correct, mandatory values MUST be present, all values MUST come from the appropriate data space.   The document SHALL also be subject to all filters defined at the node.  Documents that do not pass the filters SHALL NOT be published.  The publication process provides values for specific elements in the resource data description document.
 
If the resource data description document does not have an assigned identifier, the service SHALL assign one and return the value.  
 
If the resource data description document has an identifier and a document with the same identifier exists in the resource data description document collection, the new document SHALL be an update, replacing the existing document in total.  If the resource data description document is being updated, the value of an immutable element SHALL NOT be changed.
 
The publication process SHALL set values for publish_node, update_timestamp, node_timestamp, create_timestamp.  All timestamp values SHALL be the identical.
 
NB:  There are no restrictions on the size of a batch publish document set, either in the number of elements or the total size of the HTTP message.  An implementation SHALL indicate any size limits in the service description.
NB:  The process currently does not handle attachments.
 
Open Question:  Publishing to the node is by the node owner.  Do we need more to support trust?
NB:  The process currently does not handle attachments.

Basic Delete Service
This section is new in this version of the specification.  The remainder is not highlighted.
 
The basic delete service “deletes” an instance of a resource data description document (or a set of documents) directly from a node in a resource distribution network.  
 
Each resource data description document identified in the supplied set is deleted independently. In addition to the overall service return indicating status,  there SHALL be one returned object per resource data description document, aligned 1:1 to the documents identified in the supplied resource data description document array, indicating deletion of the resource data description document.
 
The service MAY implement different deletion policies:
1. ignore -- the deletion SHALL be acknowledged but the document is not deleted.
2. mark -- the status of the document is changed to indicate that it has been deleted.  The document SHALL NOT be returned by any access service.
3. delete -- the document SHALL be deleted.  What “deleted” means is dependent on the underlying implementation.
4. purge -- the service SHALL, at some point, remove deleted documents.
 
NB:  There are no restrictions on the size of a batch publish document set, either in the number of elements or the total size of the HTTP message.  An implementation SHALL indicate any size limits in the service description.
NB:  Only the owner of a document may delete it.
NB:  The deletion process SHALL be consistent with the resource data persistence policy.

Resource Data Access Services
Access services are used to pull resource data from the network.  They are used by access edge nodes to obtain one or more resource data description documents for “off network” processing.  Future drafts or versions of this specification MAY define additional resource data access services.
Basic Obtain Service
The basic obtain service pulls an instance of a resource data description document (or a set of documents) directly from a node on a resource distribution network.  It is the most basic, direct mechanism to access resource data. 
 
For the list of supplied resource data description document IDs, the service SHALL return the corresponding resource data description document from the node’s resource data description document database if it exists.  The results SHALL be aligned 1:1 with the IDs in the request.  If the ID does not match a resource data description document in the node’s resource data description document database, the result object returned SHALL by NULL.
 
NB:  There are no restrictions on number of requested documents or in the total size of the HTTP message or response.  An implementation SHALL indicate any size limits in the service description.
NB:  The process currently does not handle attachments.
 
ToDo: Extend to provide a usage record of the obtain.

Basic Harvest Service
This section is new in this version of the specification.  The remainder is not highlighted.
 
The basic harvest service can be used by an external agent to connect to a node to harvest (pull) the resource data description documents held by the node.  The service is patterned after the OAI-PMH specification.  The service is designed to be extended to support full OAI-PMH–compliant harvesting.
 
The service can harvest the native JSON encoded metadata or paradata resource data, i.e., it harvests the resource data in the native format, not XML-encoded Dublin Core metadata.  Set-based harvesting is not currently supported.  Flow control is not currently supported.  OAI-PMH verbs are included directly in the HTTP path (rather than as an argument to provide a more RESTful API).  Both GET and POST encoding of requests are supported.

	ListSets Verb

Each of the six harvest verbs are specified separately.  The Service Description document SHALL apply to the entire API.
 
The network node SHALL maintain a value for the earliest publication time for documents harvestable from the node (earliestDatestamp).  Time-based harvesting MAY request harvest for documents published, updated or deleted after that time.  The node MAY maintain documents with an earlier timestamp, but these documents SHALL NOT be accessible via harvest.  The granularity for access via the timestamp MAY be days or seconds.  The granularity of the timestamp SHALL be stored in the service description document.
NB:  The actual timestamp MAY have a finer granularity.
Get Record
The Get Record verb returns the resource data description document for the specified resource data document ID.  The API only returns JSON.  Different metadata formats cannot be specified.
NB:  The process currently does not handle attachments.
 
ToDo: Extend to provide a usage record of the harvest.

List Identifiers
The List Identifiers verb returns the header information resource data description document for the specified resource data document IDs within a specified time/date range.  The API only returns JSON.  Different metadata formats cannot be specified.  Flow control is not supported.  Set-based harvesting is not supported.
 
The API is functionally equivalent to the List Records API, only header information and no resource data is not returned.  Data elements are renamed to match the OAI-PMH specification.

OAI-PMH Harvest Service
The OAI-PMH harvest services can be used by an external agent to connect to a node to harvest (pull) the metadata contained in the resource data description documents stored at the node.  The service defines how to harvest a variety of metadata formats (DC, LOM), paradata formats, etc., along with full resource data description documents stored at the node.  Unless specified, the service SHALL support OAI-PMH V2.0.
 
The complete specification of the OAI-PMH harvest service will be provided in a future draft of the specification.  The service supports a subset of the functionality defined in the OAI-PMH specification.
The service could be built using basic harvest.  All the core functionality is present in basic harvest.  A transformation would be applied to the results.  DC (or other) metadata elements are extracted from the resource data and it is transformed from JSON to XML.

Administrative Services
Administrative services are used to trigger network node administrative operations, to determine node status or to retrieve descriptive information about a network node.  Future drafts or versions of this specification MAY define additional administrative services.  Future drafts or versions of this specification MAY define additional service query arguments that will customize the returned data.
 
Open Question:  Do we need to have separate services to return node filters (now part of the general node description) or node connectivity (currently not retrievable).
 
All administrative services SHALL support HTTP content negotiation.  All administrative services SHALL support return of CONTENT-TYPE: text/plain.  All administrative services SHOULD support return of text/html, text/xml, application/rdf+xml.
Network Node Status Service
The network node status service is used to return information and operational data about a network node.  The service SHALL return all of the key-value pairs listed that have a valid value.  The service MAY return additional key-value pairs that indicate status.
 
A network node SHALL maintain all of the data necessary to return the required key-value pairs.

Broker Services
Broker services operate at a network node to process, transform, augment, amplify or otherwise manipulate the resource data held at a node.  No broker services are currently defined.  Broker services will be defined in future drafts or versions of the specification.
Common Data Model and API Attributes and Behaviors
The definition of several common attributes shared across all data models and APIs, along with common API behaviors are specified here as a single point of specification.  In case of a discrepancy, the definition here SHALL take precedence over the definition elsewhere in this specification.
Data Model Attributes
Identifiers
Most data models include one or more identifiers.  An identifier SHALL be unique within a defined scope or context.  Unless otherwise specified, the scope for all identifiers SHALL be all implementations of the Learning Registry.  Unless otherwise specified by an implementation, an identifier SHALL conform to ISO/IEC 11578:1998, ISO/IEC 9834-8, RFC 4122,  and SHOULD use Version 5 (SHA-1 Hash).  These specifications standardize the generic OSF DCE UUID.  As a data type, an identifier is commonly encoded as a string.
 
NB: What is called an identifier in a data model is more precisely just a label.  The use of the label to identify an instance of the data model within the scope or context of the Learning Registry makes it an identifier (within that scope).
 
NB: For many items, the scope could be all implementations of the Learning Registry within one network 
community.  Extending the scope to all implementations is an intentional simplification.
 
Open Question: UUID Version 1 (MAC Address) Version 5 (SHA-1 Hash)?
Strings and Internationalization
All character strings SHALL support full UTF-8 encoding of Unicode character representation.
Time and Date
The format for all times and dates SHALL conform to ISO 8601.  All times SHALL include a Time Zone designator.  ToDo: Specify JSON encoding.
API Attributes and Behaviors
Description here about RESTful APIs, CoolURIs, Context negotiation, application/JSON vs text/plain
 
HTTP requests SHALL use HTTP 1.1.   Communications MAY use TLS.
 
HTTP requests SHOULD include a CONTENT-TYPE header.  Unless noted, the header SHOULD be 
CONTENT-TYPE: application/JSON
 
HTTP responses SHOULD include a CONTENT-TYPE header.   Unless noted, the header SHOULD be CONTENT-TYPE: text/plain; charset=utf=8
Transactional Behaviors and Data Consistency
Unless stated in an individual API specification, transactional atomicity SHALL BE document granularity. 
 
Requirements for consistency of documents across multiple nodes apply only when the nodes are consistent.  Prior to, or during document distribution, documents MAY be inconsistent.
NB:  The distribution model assumes the underlying system SHALL produce eventual consistency.
Resource Data Validation and Publication
All resource data publishing services SHALL validate all submitted documents before the document is stored at the node.
1. All required fields SHALL be present.
2. Only mutable fields MAY be changed in an update.
3. The node MAY reject an anonymous submission or any other submission according to its policy.
4. The node SHALL reject a submission without a known terms of service.
5. The node SHALL reject a submission where the payload does not correspond with the declared payload.
6. The node MAY validate an attached or linked payload.
7. The node SHALL validate an inline payload.
8. Prior attachments SHALL be deleted in an update.
9. Default values SHALL be filled in.
10. Node-specific fields SHALL be filled in.
 
Resource Data Validation and Publication
        // Validate a resource data description document
        // is the submission well formed
        IF any required element is missing
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT        
        // changes in mutable fields are only allowed in an update
        IF submission is an update
                IF any immutable field in the new document does not match old field
                        THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        // does the node support this type of submission
        IF node policy does not accept submitter_type = “anonymous”
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        // does the node accept the specified TOS
        IF node policy does not accept the specified submitter_TOS
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        // does the payload match the declaration
        IF payload_placement = “linked” and no payload_locator provided
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        IF payload_placement = “inline” and no resource_document in the submission 
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        IF payload_placement = “attached” and no attachment
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        // payload must match the schema and validate
        IF payload_schema does not correspond to resource_data_type
                THEN
REJECT the document
EXIT
        VALIDATE the payload
        // updates invalidate existing attachments
        IF submission is an update
                THEN delete any attachments
        // Generate the ID if required
IF doc_ID isn’t provided
                THEN generate a doc_ID
        // Set local node data
        publish_node := node_id
        IF submission is an update
                THEN 
update_timestamp := node_timestamp := current time  // granularity of seconds
ELSE
        create_timestamp :=update_timestamp := node_timestamp := current time
        IF frbr_level not specified
                THEN frbr_level := “copy”
Open Question:  Should an update delete the attachments automatically, or should this be an option?
Resource Data Filtering
All resource data publishing services and resource data distribution services apply filters to resource data.  If a network node filter document is stored at a node, the filter SHALL be applied to a resource data description document before the document is stored at the node.
 
Either a custom filter or expression-based filters MAY be defined.  If there is a custom filter (expressed in custom code at the node), expression-based filters SHALL be ignored.  A custom filter SHOULD NOT be used when the filters can be expressed using expression-based filters.
 
A filter defines either the resource data documents that pass the filter (and are stored; all other resource data documents are not stored), or resource data documents that are rejected by the filter (and are not stored, all other documents are stored).
 
An expression-based filter contains a list of regular expressions that are used to match keywords/names in the resource data description document, and a regular expression that is used to match values for the keywords.  If the filter key matches any keyword/name in the resource data, and if any value for that key in the resource data matches the filter value, the filter is successful, i.e., for an “include” filter, the document is included; for an exclude filter, the document is “excluded”.  Matching is an “or”.   A successful match short circuits further matching.
 
The filter SHALL be applied against all top-level elements in the resource data description document.  Behavior for filtering against linked resource data, attachments or the inline resource data is not currently defined.
 
Resource Data Filtering

        // Filter a resource data description document
        // No filter test
        IF the network node filter description document does NOT exist
                THEN store the resource data description document 
                        EXIT
        // Filter not active test
        IF NOT active in the network node filter description document
                THEN store the resource data description document
                        EXIT
        // Use custom filter if defined
        IF custom_filter in the the network node filter description document
                THEN eval the custom filter code
                        IF the code returns true 
THEN store the resource data description document
EXIT
        // Expression-based filtering
        // Does the filter match the document
        match := F
        FOR EACH filter in the network node filter description document
                FOR EACH key/name in the resource data description document
                IF the filter_key REGEX matches the key/name
                        IF the filter_value is NULL
                                THEN match := T
                                        SKIP ALL
                        FOR EACH value of the  key/name in the resource data description document
                                IF the filter_value REGEX matches the value 
                                        THEN match := T
                                                SKIP ALL
        // Store or reject
        IF include_exclude 
IF match  // matches what to include
                        THEN  store the resource data description document
                                EXIT
                        ELSE EXIT // don’t store

Operations
This section outlines one approach of how to use the specified network model, data models and APIs to set up and operate a Learning Registry network community. 
Networks and Communities
Building the Network Description
Node-specific information (i.e., description, filters, services and connectivity) SHALL be maintained on a per node basis.  Authorized document updates MAY be applied only at the node.  All node-specific information MAY be maintained in a node document collection per node.
 
Network-specific information (i.e., network description, network policy) SHALL be replicated on a per node basis.  The initial document MAY be stored at any node in the network.  Authorized document updates MAY be applied at any node in the network.  Replication, using the node’s connectivity information, MAY be used to propagate the documents throughout the network.  All network-specific information MAY be maintained in a network document collection per node.  
 
Community-specific information (i.e., community description) SHALL be replicated on a per node basis.  The initial document MAY be stored at any node in the network.  Authorized document updates MAY be applied at any node in the community.  Replication, using the node’s connectivity information, MAY be used to propagate the documents throughout the network, including across network gateways between different communities.  All community-specific information MAY be maintained in a community document collection per node.
 
The overall network description MAY be inconsistent when publishing individual documents that describe the network.  When using document propagation, the node’s document collections MAY be out of sync, temporarily violating the requirement for identical values at all nodes.  Eventual consistency SHALL be enforced.  NB:  Need to determine if lack of sync can introduce any security holes.
 
An implementation MAY place the node-specific information in one document database that is not replicated, network-specific information in a second database that is replicated throughout the network, and community-specific information in a third database that is replicated across the community.   Resource data is stored in another database that is replicated throughout the community using the defined connectivity.
Except for a optional local node storage used to maintain private state that is not replicated, other document databases SHALL NOT be defined for the purpose of holding node-specific, network-specific or community-specific information.
 
Open Issue: As defined, gateways permit networks that allow documents to be replicated into the network from another network, but do not permit documents to be replicated out of the network (unless there is a corresponding bi-directional link).  With such a topology, community-specific information cannot reach all nodes if it is published to a node within a network with no outbound flow; the information will not reach other networks.  Possible solutions:
1. publish the community-specific information to a node in each network that does not have outbound connectivity.
2. define a distribution strategy (and possible extensions of node connectivity information) to allow bi-directional flow across network gateways or that limit flow based on document type.
3. define node connections that provide only for distribution of network or community information, not resource data.
Likewise, gateways transmit documents across network boundaries.  They do not limit distribution to be within a single network.  Thus network-specific documents can cross network boundaries.  Possible solutions:
1. define a distribution strategy that is limited to a network and not across gateways.
2. define node connections that provide only for distribution of network information.
NB: The procedures described below are currently incomplete and do not implement any of these solutions.  They call for “network wide” (meaning network restricted) or “community wide” distribution.
 
Open Question:  How to establish a security model so that only an authorized user may update a description at any node.  Is it necessary to sign the descriptions or to store a public key in a description?
 
Open Question:  How to constrain the network so that if someone finds a connection, they cannot exploit it.
 
The network model MAY be instantiated in a set of procedures.  The procedures assume the resource distribution network description document, resource distribution network policy document and network community description document are published before the network is expanded from the base node.  If network expansion is done prior to these documents being created, appropriate Distribution processes SHALL be triggered after the documents are published to distribute them to all nodes in the network or community.  
 
NB: The procedures only establish the network structure and descriptive documents.  They do not populate the network with resource data.  In particular, adding a new node to a network does not load resource data into the node’s resource data description document database.
 
The procedures include VALIDATE steps which are explicit semantic rules that need to be enforced, generally involving values in different documents.  The procedures also include REJECT steps.  These are general rules designed to check if a document is well formed, that all mandatory fields are present, that values are from constrained vocabularies, that immutable values are not changed on update, etc.  The procedure exits without changing the state of any database if validation fails (i.e., the procedure is a transaction).

Maintaining Networks and Communities
An established network or community MAY be maintained by updating descriptions of network nodes, their services, their connectivity, descriptions of resource distribution networks and of network communities.  By definition, elements of the network model SHALL NOT be deleted; they are transitioned from active to not active.  NB: The data models contain forward links to other models.  Deleting a document would require network-level garbage collection to determine when all links to a document have been deleted.
 
If updating the description of a network node, its services or connectivity, the description of a the distribution network or the network community causes the descriptions to violate the requirements for the network description, the node SHALL NOT be considered to be a part of the corresponding distribution network and network community and SHALL NOT participate in any network or resource operations.

        // may proceed asynchronously
Network Discovery
Finding all the nodes in a network or community is a non core service.  One approach is to use replication and distribution to build a complete list of all network links at each node (an alternative is to traverse the network and build the link structure).  Given a database of node-specific documents that includes a node’s connectivity that is not replicated (private to the node), and a second duplicate database that is replicated across the entire network or community, first replicate the connectivity document from the private node database to the network or community database stored at the node.  This replication is done at each node in the network.  It is a one-way replication from the private node database to the second database, not a full synchronization.  Then distribute (synchronize) the second database across all nodes. Distribution (synchronization) across nodes of the network or community database will build a network connectivity link table at each node.  
 
The completeness of the table in showing the entire network or part of the network will depend on the connectivity and gateways, i.e., the connectivity of a network will not be propagated to nodes outside the network unless there is a directional gateway.  The tables of networks or communities with only inbound connectivity will include the entries of the external networks.
 
NB: This process only builds the network link table at a point in time.  It does not provide real-time connectivity status.
Network Design
Any resource distribution network is technically open; any node MAY connect.  Managing connectivity and details of the topology and operations of any specific resource distribution network (and its connection to other resource distribution networks and network communities) SHALL be determined by the governance and policy rules of a resource distribution network or network node, not via this specification.
 
Multiple resource distribution networks and network communities MAY be established and connected.  In addition to external governance and policies, this specification imposes restrictions on connections between network communities and resource distribution networks, i.e., 1:1 connections only using gateway nodes.  Because of the technical burden imposed, multiple resource distribution networks and network communities SHOULD only be created when these specification-imposed criteria are needed to enable additional security and technical criteria that cannot be adequately satisfied by policy alone.  
 
For example, connecting an open community in an open IP space to a more restricted community might involve establishing a gateway node in the open community in a public IP space, providing a gateway node in for the restricted community in a DMZ, opening limited network ports between the DMZ and the other nodes in restricted community that operate within a closed IP space (possibly using an additional gateway), and locking down the connections between the open community and the DMZ gateway node.  The illustration shows an example of such a gateway structure.
 
Resource Data Publication, Distribution and Access
Once a resource distribution network has been established, external agents use the publish services at network nodes to publish or update resource data to nodes in the resource distribution network.  Network nodes SHALL store the valid, published resource data in their resource data description documents database.  Publication MAY be performed via any of the supplied publish services or via tools and applications that are built upon these services.  Other mechanisms to publish resource data SHALL NOT be supported. 
 
Publication SHALL satisfy trust and identity conditions.  The same resource data may be published to one or more nodes in one or more resource distribution networks subject to their policies and the trust and identity conditions.
 
Publication SHALL satisfy network node filters.  Only resource data that passes the filters (if they exist) SHALL be published.  Filters are optional.  
 
Publication SHALL add or update any node-specific data.
 
In distribution, destination nodes SHALL filter all incoming resource data.  Only resource data that passes the filters (if they exist) SHALL be persisted.  Filters are optional.  
 
Distribution SHALL add or update any node-specific data.
 
Resource distribution network nodes distribute their data to other nodes.  If a network node provides the resource data distribution service, it SHALL periodically launch the resource data distribution service to distribute resource data from the node to its connected nodes.  Any node that wants to establish a connection with another node, i.e., wants to be the target of distribution, SHALL support the necessary core services that allow the source node to distribute data to it.
 
Resource data is available for access by external agents through the access services at network nodes.  Access MAY be provided via any of the supplied access services or via tools and applications that are built using these services.  Other mechanisms to access resource data SHALL NOT be supported.
 
Access SHALL satisfy trust and identity conditions.  When available via distribution, the same resource data may be accessed from one or more nodes in one or more resource distribution networks, subject to their policies and the trust and identity conditions.
 
Resource distribution network nodes MAY provide broker services.  Operation of a broker service SHALL be determined by the governance and policy rules of a resource distribution network or network node, not via this specification.
 
Service provisioning (publish, access, distribution, broker) SHALL be determined by the governance and policy rules of a resource distribution network or network node, not via this specification.
Resource Data Persistence
A node SHALL persist resource data stored at a node for at least as many days as specified by the TTL (time to live) in the resource distribution network policy description.  A node MAY “delete” documents that have been stored longer than the network’s TTL.  
 
If the node supports harvest, the node SHALL maintain a value for earliestDatestamp. This value is the oldest publish, update or delete time for a resource data description document that can be accessed at the node via harvest.  The timestamp SHALL be precise to the nearest second.  The value is based on the time the resource data description documents are published at the node (node_timestamp).
 
Access to information about the deletion of resource data is governed by a node-specific policy, deleted_data_policy:
1. no -- the node SHALL not expose any data about deleted resource data description documents.  The node MAY maintain information about deletions.
2. persistent -- the node SHALL maintain and expose data about deleted resource data description documents.  Information about deleted resource data SHALL be persisted as long as the node remains active, i.e., information about deletion is not governed by the TTL.
3. transient -- the node MAY maintain and expose data about deleted resource data description documents.  The node MAY establish any policy for how long or if it maintains and exposes data about deleted resource data description documents.
 
NB: This is the information about the deletion, not the actual deletion.  What it means to “delete” a document is not specified, e.g., it is removed or just marked as deleted.  Tracking of deletions MAY be independent of the actual TTL and the actual deletion of the resource data.
Open Question:  Should the data persistence policies be network, not node, specific.
 
Open Issue:  Using pure replication, when one node deletes a document, the delete will propagate.  This MAY invalidate the required information about the tracking and persistence of deletions.  What is the model for deletion versus TTL and access to deletion status for harvest?
Network Administration
Resource distribution network nodes MAY provide administrative services.  Operation of an administrative service SHALL be determined by the governance and policy rules of a resource distribution network or network node, not via this specification.
 
Provisioning of administrative services SHALL be determined by the governance and policy rules of a resource distribution network or network node, not via this specification.
 
Open Question:  Do we need to make any administrative services mandatory?
Open Question:  Do we need a mechanism to control access to network data models beyond authentication controls?
Glossary
The following terms are used in this document as defined.
Additional terms will be provided in a future draft or version of the specification.
 
access (v):  to obtain resource data from a network node by an agent that is external to a resource distribution network.
 
broker (n):  a server process that provides transformative or data amplification processing of resource data.
 
community (n):  see network community.
 
common node (n):  a network node in a resource distribution network that may provide any service to process resource data and that may connect to any other node in the same resource distribution network for the distribution of resource data within the resource distribution network.
 
distribute (v):  to copy or synchronize resource data from one network node to another.
 
gateway node (n):  a network node in a resource distribution network that provides an interconnection to a network node in a different resource distribution network (either in the same network community or in a different network community) for the distribution of resource data across the network boundary.
 
harvest (v): to access a network node and obtain sets of resource data; the accessing agent is the harvestor; the network node is the harvestee.  Harvest is typically based on timestamps used to identify new resource data held at the harvestee.
 
identifier (n): the name (i.e., a label [e.g., a string] in an authoritative context) associated with a thing (anything that can be given an identifier).
 
learning resource (n):  any (digital) resource that is designed for, or has been used, in an educational context.
 
metadata (n):  formally authored and curated information describing a learning resource.  Also denoted first party metadata.
 
network (n):  see resource distribution network. A network need not correspond to a physical or logical network of computing devices.
 
network community (n):  a group of interconnected resource distribution networks.  
 
network node (n):  a service end point in a resource distribution network that may provide services to process resource data and that may connect to any other nodes to distribute resource data.  A network node need not correspond to a physical or logical computing device.
 
node (n):  see network node.
 
paradata (n):  information describing the contextual use of a learning resource.  It includes informally authored information and data obtained directly through monitoring the use of a learning resource, its metadata or its paradata.  Also denoted second party metadata.
 
publish (v):  to submit resource data to a network node from a source external to the node’s resource distribution network.
 
pull (v):  to distribute resource data from A to B, initiated by B.
 
push (v):  to distribute resource data from A to B, initiated by A.
 
resource (n):  see learning resource.
 
resource data (n):  any data that describes a learning resource, including, but not limited to metadata and paradata.
 
resource distribution network (n):  a group of interconnected network nodes that operate under an agreed set of policies.
 
service (n):  a process applied to resource data or system descriptive and operational data operating on a network node.
