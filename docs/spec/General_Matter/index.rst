Learning Registry Overview
--------------------------

The Learning Registry [`http <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flearningregistry.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH0Q7yFYPqAD-Zg9qiJ8rq8DVYYKg>`_://`learningregistry <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flearningregistry.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH0Q7yFYPqAD-Zg9qiJ8rq8DVYYKg>`_.`org <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flearningregistry.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH0Q7yFYPqAD-Zg9qiJ8rq8DVYYKg>`_/] aims to make “learning resources easier to **find**, easier to **access** and easier to **integrate** into learning environments *wherever* they are stored -- around the country and the world.” It defines a learning resource distribution network model and a set of open APIs and open interoperability standards to provide three fundamental, enabling capabilities:

1. a lightweight mechanism to publish (push) learning resources (or metadata or paradata describing the resources) into a learning resource distribution network, independent of format or data type (e.g., resource, metadata or paradata);

2. the ability for anyone to consume the published data and then, in turn, to publish additional feedback about the resources’ use into the network (e.g., additional paradata), amplifying the overall knowledge about the resources;

3. a high-latency, loosely connected network of master-master synchronizing brokers distributing resources, metadata and paradata.

There is no central control, central registries or central repositories in the core resource distribution network.
Published data can eventually flow to all nodes in the network.
The network aims to be self assembling.
Edge services can connect to any distribution node to find out what resources (and resource sources) are in the network, what’s changed, what’s being used, etc.
Organizations may build consumer-facing, value-added services at the edge nodes to enable using, finding, sharing, and amplifying the resources, metadata and paradata for user communities.
The Learning Registry provides *social* *networking* *for* *metadata* (trusted social collaboration around learning resources), enabling a *learning* *layer* on the social web.

Notation
--------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the Learning Registry Technical Specification are to be interpreted as described in `RFC <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftools.ietf.org%2Fhtml%2Frfc2119&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEifotriMBsHSbNZlbtV_IVSzvraQ>`_` 2119 <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftools.ietf.org%2Fhtml%2Frfc2119&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEifotriMBsHSbNZlbtV_IVSzvraQ>`_.

The vocabulary of terms used in describing the Learning Registry and in the Learning Registry Technical Specification are listed in the :ref:`Glossary<h.8n9oub9badbo>`.
Specific terms are set in **bold** when introduced in context.

Data models are described in a JSON-like notation.
It follows JSON syntax, but instead of providing the value for a name, the data model defines the JavaScript data type of the named element.
A description of the element, further restrictions on the value space (e.g., if a string is a URL) and if the element is optional or required is described in a comment.
This model is used for convenience in early prototyping.
A future version of the specification may describe the data models and their implementation binding independently.



.. _h.whmj37vjr0jk:

-----------
Conformance
-----------

There is no overall conformance statement for the Learning Registry Technical Specification.
The Learning Registry Test Suite (link TBD) MAY be used to test an implementation.
However, passing the Test Suite does not imply conformance to this specification.
There is no defined “reference implementation” (by definition when there is a conflict between this specification and the reference implementation, the reference implementation is considered to be authoritative -- thus the lack of a reference implementation implies that the Learning Registry Technical Specification is authoratitive).

All pseudo code is informative; it is not a normative implementation design.
Behaviors defined in pseudo code are normative requirements on an implementation.
Behaviors are usually defined in normative text.

An organization MAY place tighter requirements on an implementation than those stated, e.g., it MAY constrain a MAY, SHOULD or OPTIONAL clause to MUST, SHALL or REQUIRED.
It MAY NOT relax any constraint.

Technical Specification Overview
--------------------------------

The Learning Registry Technical Specification is split into several parts:

- **Network**: The description of the resource distribution network and its parts.
  A fixed multi-level structure of network parts is used to support distributing content and to provide policy-based security and operations.

- **Data** **Models**: The data models that are used to describe the network and learning resources data.
  Data models are document oriented.

- **Services** **and** **APIs**: The APIs used to publish and consume data and those used to operate the network.
  The APIs are designed to abstract the logical behaviors of the Learning Registry from any particular implementation tools.

- ▲:changes:`**General** **Requirements**: Common behaviors and attributes that apply to all data models and behaviors.`

- ▲:changes:`**Identity** **and** **Trust****:** Models of trust, authentication, authorization, identity and security.
  These models are applied to all data models and operations.`

- **Operations**: Operational procedures that apply to any implementation.



.. _h.9vpjmlmi28mv:


Design Principles
=================

The learning registry design and technical specification is based on several key principles:

- **Decentralized**: There are no centralized registries or repositories or central data stores.
  Thus all core data is replicated across the network.

- **Redundant**: There is no single point of failure in the design (an implementation may have single points of failure).

- **Abstracted**: Abstraction is critical to layering capabilities, e.g., network content replication is content type agnostic.
  

- **Minimal**: Specify only what is required.
  Features that are community specific or can be layered on top of the core design are excluded from the specification although essential elements needed to support such modeling are included.

- **Generic**: Prefer approaches, models, standards, etc., that have wide uptake beyond just the learning technology and digital repository space.

- **Secure**: Security is by design, e.g., default values lock down an implementation and must be explicitly overridden even to do common operations.

- **Trusted**: Data and operations need to be authentic and trusted

- **Document** **Oriented**: The design is targeted at a document-oriented system for implementation using document-oriented databases.

- **RESTful**: APIs are RESTful, and use `CoolURIs <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fcooluris%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFF57WOpfu4EyZdRMGJKnodAVjexg>`_ to return different data representations.

- **Scalable**: The design needs to seamlessly scale and perform at scale.

- **Extensible** **and** **Enabling**: The design is meant to enable new capabilities.
  Unless explicitly restricted (usually to satisfy security requirements) anything in the design is extensible.

- **Web**** 2.0 ****Friendly**: The design is based on current, widely implemented Web 2.0 technologies.
